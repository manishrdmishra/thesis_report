    abstract = {Mitochondria are key players in several cellular functions including growth, division, energy metabolism, and apoptosis. The mitochondrial network undergoes constant remodelling and these morphological changes are of direct relevance for the role of this organelle in cell physiology. Mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to a number of human disorders and may aid cancer progression. Here, we summarize the recent contributions made in the field of mitochondrial dynamics and
        discuss their impact on our understanding of cell function and tumorigenesis.},

    abstract = {Deep learning allows computational models that are composed of multiple processing layers to learn representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction. These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in speech recognition, visual object recognition, object detection and many other domains such as drug discovery and genomics. Deep learning discovers intricate structure in large data sets by using the backpropagation algorithm to indicate how a
        machine should change its internal parameters that are used to compute the representation in each layer from the representation in the previous layer. Deep convolutional nets have brought about breakthroughs in processing images, video, speech and audio, whereas recurrent nets have shone light on sequential data such as text and speech.},

    abstract = {Apoptotic cell death involves a ritual series of morphological changes, presumably reflecting a conserved molecular pathway. We now report that the nuclear events typical of apoptosis can be reproduced in "apoptotic" Xenopus egg extracts. In this cell-free system, nuclear assembly and protein import are initially normal; after 2-4 hr, however, a process of nuclear destruction ensues involving chromatin condensation and the shrinkage and fragmentation of the nuclei. This
        apoptotic process, which also occurs in nuclei added exogenously, is blocked by the addition of baculovirus-expressed Bcl-2 protein. To block the disintegration of nuclei that are added later, Bcl-2 must be present during this latent period. "Apoptosis" in these extracts requires a dense organelle fraction enriched in mitochondria. The cell-free system described here provides a novel tool for understanding intracellular events in apoptosis and the inhibitory function of
            Bcl-2.},

    abstract = {We recently reported a new method to isolate functionally intact mitochondria from cell culture and small tissue samples (Schmitt et al., Anal Biochem 443(1):66-74, 2013). This method comprises a semi-automated cell rupture, termed pump controlled cell rupture system (PCC), which can be precisely adjusted to the specific cellular source of isolation and which can be tightly controlled (Schmitt et al., Anal Biochem 443(1):66-74, 2013). Here we provide a detailed
        hands-on protocol of this PCC method which results in an efficient cell breakage but preserving the mitochondrial integrity. Upon subsequent purification steps, the obtained mitochondrial fraction meets the quality and purity required for molecular analyses, e.g. proteomic comparisons, as well as for biochemical analyses, e.g. determination of diverse enzymatic activities.},

    abstract = {Mitochondria are key organelles for cellular energy production and cell death decisions. Consequently, a plethora of conditions which are toxic to cells are known to directly attack these organelles. However, mitochondria originating from different tissues differ in their sensitivity to toxic insults. Thus, in order to predict the potential organ-specific toxicity of a given drug or pathological condition at the mitochondrial level, test settings are needed that directly
        compare the responses and vulnerabilities of mitochondria from different organs. As a prerequisite for such test strategies, we provide here a robust, prompt, and easy-to-follow step-by-step protocol to simultaneously isolate functional and intact mitochondria from rat liver, kidney, heart, and brain. This isolation procedure ensures mitochondrial preparations of comparable purity and reproducible quantities which can be subsequently analyzed for organ-specific mitochondrial
            toxicity.},

In addition to their well-known roles in oxidative phosphorylation and metabolism, it is now clear that mitochondria are also central to cell death, neoplasia, cell differentiation, the innate immune system, oxygen and hypoxia sensing, and calcium metabolism. Disruption to these processes contributes to a range of human pathologies, making mitochondria a potentially
        important, but currently seemingly neglected, therapeutic target. Mitochondrial dysfunction is often associated with oxidative damage, calcium dyshomeostasis, defective ATP synthesis, or induction of the permeability transition pore. Consequently, therapies designed to prevent these types of damage are beneficial and can be used to treat many diverse and apparently unrelated indications. Here we outline the biological properties that make mitochondria important determinants of health
            and disease, and describe the pharmacological strategies being developed to address mitochondrial dysfunction.},

    abstract = {A pathological increase of the permeability of the mitochondrial membranes may culminate in the irreversible rupture of the mitochondrial outer membrane. Such a permeability transition is lethal because it results in the release of death-inducing molecules from mitochondria and/or metabolic failure. Current methods to assess this outer membrane damage are mostly indirect or scarcely representative of the overall mitochondrial population. Here we present an analytical and
        preparative approach using free flow electrophoresis to directly distinguish rat liver mitochondria that have undergone the permeability transition from unaffected organelles or from organelles that are damaged to a minor degree. Mitochondrial populations, which considerably differ in outer membrane integrity or cytochrome c content, were separated by this means. We further show that the relative abundance of each population depends on the dose of the permeability transition inducer
            and the duration of the treatment time. Finally, we have employed this approach to investigate the impairment of mitochondria that were isolated from livers subjected to ischemia/reperfusion damage.},

abstract = {This work presents and analyzes three convolutional neural network (CNN) models for efficient pixelwise classification of images. When using convolutional neural networks to classify single pixels in patches of a whole image, a lot of redundant computations are carried out when using sliding window networks. This set of new architectures solve this issue by either removing redundant computations or using fully convolutional architectures that inherently predict many pixels at once.   The implementations of the three models are accessible through a new utility on top of the Caffe library. The utility provides support for a wide range of image input and output formats, pre-processing parameters and methods to equalize the label histogram during training. The Caffe library has been extended by new layers and a new backend for availability on a wider range of hardware such as CPUs and GPUs through OpenCL.   On AMD GPUs, speedups of {\$}54\backslashtimes{\$} (SK-Net), {\$}437\backslashtimes{\$} (U-Net) and {\$}320\backslashtimes{\$} (USK-Net) have been observed, taking the SK equivalent SW (sliding window) network as the baseline. The label throughput is up to one megapixel per second.   The analyzed neural networks have distinctive characteristics that apply during training or processing, and not every data set is suitable to every architecture. The quality of the predictions is assessed on two neural tissue data sets, of which one is the ISBI 2012 challenge data set. Two different loss functions, Malis loss and Softmax loss, were used during training.   The whole pipeline, consisting of models, interface and modified Caffe library, is available as Open Source software under the working title Project Greentea.},
